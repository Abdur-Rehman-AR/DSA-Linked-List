DSA Linked List in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of Linked Lists and related algorithms. It covers Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List, and common operations like Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Searching, Sorting, and Advanced Manipulations.

All programs are written from scratch to help understand how nodes connect, how data moves, and how dynamic memory works in Linked Lists without relying on Java built-in classes.

📂 What’s Inside

1. Singly Linked List

  --> Insertion, Deletion, Traversal
  
  --> Reverse List, Find Middle Node, Nth Element from Last
  
  --> Remove Duplicates, Search, Update Value
  
  --> Palindrome Check

2. Doubly Linked List

   --> Insertion, Deletion, Reverse, Traversal

3. Circular Linked List

  --> Insertion, Deletion, Traversal

4. Algorithms & Utilities

  --> Merge Sort, Insertion Sort
  
  --> Pairwise Swap, Rotate, Split
  
  --> Floyd’s Cycle Detection, Remove Cycle
  
  --> Sorting 0s, 1s, 2s

5. Queue & Stack Implementations

  --> Queue using Linked List
  
  --> Stack using Linked List

⚡ Features

  --> Pure Java code, easy to read and understand
  
  --> Step-by-step node manipulation to learn pointers
  
  --> Covers both basic and advanced Linked List problems
  
  --> Ready for DSA practice and interview preparation

🛠 How to Run

Open the terminal in the project folder:
  
  --> cd "DSA_Java_Files/Linked_List"

Compile a program:
  
  --> javac FileName.java

Run the program:
  
  --> java FileName

Example:

javac Singly_Linked_List.java

java Singly_Linked_List

🎯 Why This Repo is Useful

  --> Helps visualize how Linked Lists work in Java
  
  --> Useful for DSA interviews, coding practice, and learning dynamic memory handling
  
  --> Good reference for building other data structures

📌 Notes

  --> Each file is self-contained and demonstrates one operation/algorithm
  
  --> The code is written in simple, beginner-friendly style for easy learning
